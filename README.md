## Documentation

### Docs info

documentation is still in progress. all of the docs that are currently added ar located in the `docs/` directory

## Getting started

wanna play them? pretty simple. you can use the repl link to play them via replit, or you can clone the repo and run `main.py`.

### For Repl:

go [here](https://replit.com/@orangejuiceplz/ConsolesGames)

### For Cloning

open a terminal and go to a parent folder that you want to house the files in

then,

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/NoGambling1/ConsolesGames.git
cd ConsolesGames
cd src
python main.py
```

### Special note for Unix Users

when trying to play certain games, you may encounter a message saying you don't have the correct rights to access a certain py module.

this is to be expected as you should have followed the instructions properly.

instead of running the `python main.py` command, run `sudo python main.py`. 

this command lets you elevate the program to be able to use the modules.

we are working on a way to do something else instead of using sudo for security reaosns.
