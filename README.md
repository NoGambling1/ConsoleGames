### Docs info

documentation is still in progress. all of the docs that are currently added are located in the `docs/` directory

## Getting started

wanna play them? pretty simple. you can use the repl link to play them via replit, or you can clone the repo and run `main.py`.

### For Repl:

go [here](https://replit.com/@orangejuiceplz/ConsoleGames)

### For Cloning

open a terminal and go to a directory that you want to house the files in

then,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoGambling1/ConsoleGames.git
cd ConsoleGames
```
now, make sure you have the req installed.

```python

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
now you can run,

```bash
cd src
cd gamblingandorangesconsolegames
python main.py
```
### For the lazy people

i've created a couple scripts depending on your os.

navigate to the `auto/` directory and then navigate to your os directory

for example, if you're on windows, you would go to `auto/nt/` directory and download the install.ps1

then, you can simply just run the script. it'll do the work for you lazy people.
