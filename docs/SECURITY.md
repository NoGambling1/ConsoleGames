## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Reporting Etiquette 

Please do not harrass, give rude comments, not provide context, etc. Act like a dignified person and we will treat you with respect.

Don't submit joke vulernabilities. We're fine with joke issues/PR's regarding anything else, but do refrain from joking about vulnerabilties.

#### IF YOUR REPORT WAS ***DECLINED***

DO **NOT** submit another issue. We will not be fixing this/ and or you didn't submit with enough information and haven't responded in a timely fashion.

(This is **HIGHLY** unlikey if you followed proper reporting etiquette.)

#### IF YOUR REPORT WAS ***ACCEPTED***

Expect a commit with the security issue being fixed within < one and a half days maximum.

Your name will be mentioned as a thank you.

With that being said, there are two methods to reporting a security vulnerability with the code.

### Method 1: Via the Discord Server

Report any vulerabilities in the #coding channel in the discord server. You can find the link to the discord server in the [README.md](https://github.com/NoGambling1/ConsolesGames/blob/main/README.md) file.

### Method 2: Opening an Issue

Open an issue with the relevant files and LoC that have the vulnerabilties. If possible, open a pull request with a fix with the security issues so we can review it.
